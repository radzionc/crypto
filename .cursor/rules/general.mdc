- Always try to follow the same style as the rest of the codebase.

## Pattern matching

- Never use switch-case. Instead do pattern matching with a function like @match.ts or in React - @Match.tsx
- To match react query state, use components such as [MatchQuery.tsx](mdc:lib/ui/query/components/MatchQuery.tsx) or [MatchEagerQuery.tsx](mdc:lib/ui/query/components/MatchEagerQuery.tsx)
